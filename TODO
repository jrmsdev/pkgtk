* run pkg upgrade instead of pkg update on startup?

* package upgrade fetch only

* pkgrepo: remove existent config

* pkgrepo: create a new config (using /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf as template)

* check modified open files?
    * parse cmd output for modified packages (look for "extracting" lines)
    * based on pkg list of each modified package
        * check with fstat if the modified file is open
            * report process that needs to be reloaded/restarted

* (xdg/)desktop integration: icons, menu entry and such...
  maybe systray support too?

* do not allow closing windows if background proc is running

* go to list of installed packages after installing a package from a search?
