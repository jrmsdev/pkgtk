* sleep (1) after running auto repo update on start, to show the command output

* pkgrepo: create a new config (using /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf as template)

* (xdg/)desktop integration: icons, menu entry and such...
  maybe systray support too?

* do not allow closing windows if background proc is running
