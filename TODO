* pkgrepo: check at least one repo remains enabled

* pkgsearch: add options... like search in pkg comment/description, etc...

* run pkg update at startup but ignore errors if the user has not enough
  privileges... (?) as the user may just want to take a look to current state of
  packages info... (?)
